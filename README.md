# Defekt
 The typeface is inspired by Lemâ€™s characters from The Cyberiad and The Star Diaries and the notion that death can be reversed or prevented by repairing the mechanism. Another major inspiration are monospaced typefaces. The variation involves two steps: in the first, cutting off and moving parts of the characters; in the second, moving parts of the letters up or down, resulting in an abstract, distorted image.
